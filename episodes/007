For this special Halloween installment of Tuesday Night Music Club, us four brothers of darkness will be conducting a séance to resurrect the Ghost Of Metal Past in the form of White Zombie's acid-washed, industrial-smelted, diesel-fueled, ghouls-and-goblins, The End Is Nigh, proto-Nü Metal, trailer-park hoedown, lowbrow masterpiece, 'Astro-Creep: 2000 – Songs of Love, Destruction and Other Synthetic Delusions of the Electric Head' (affectionately known as 'Astro-Creep: 2000').

The brainchild of performer, illustrator and film-maker, Rob Zombie, White Zombie carried enormous expectation into their fourth album (their second for Geffen) after Beavis & Butt-head belatedly put their 1992 album, 'La Sexorcisto' on the "Headbanger's Ball" map[1]. In crossover hit, "More Human Than Human", and alternative smashes like "Electric Head pt. 2", "Super-Charger Heaven" and "Blur The Technicolour", they well and truly delivered.

Hemorrhaging with schlocky B-movie samples, tripped out tattoo-parlour imagery and the kind of campy grandeur that would make Alice Cooper blush, 'Astro-Creep' represents the bold future of metal from the vantage point of 1995 (when Fred Durst was still a twinkle in his mother's asshole, and the year "2000" still sounded like the stuff of "Sliders" episodes). It's foray into genre-fusion was further cemented with the release of trend-bucking, full-length remix album, 'Supersexy Swingin' Sounds', a year later.

In celebration of White Zombie's eponymous undead creature, we too will be feasting on the souls of the living through the ingestion of delicious Fried Lambs' Brains with dipping sauce. The creamy cerebrums and cerebellums will be accompanied by other spooky side dishes, for those too squeamish to fill up on grey-matter.

Happy Haunting.
