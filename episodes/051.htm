2005. Steve Moore was still a year away from discovering Music. Mark Dodds was working full-time on The D12 Message Board / being in love with Someone. Cam Ward had black fingernails. Nathan Wood was working as a court reporter for the Wagga Gazette. Steve Holcroft was working as an Electrician and being a man. Nick Hammond was being more of a man.

And, while all these special events would be enough to reserve this year it's rightful spot in the Historical Anals of Time (#SteveMoore), there was also another key event - a New Zealand punk band called The Mint Chicks released their debut album 'Fuck The Golden Youth'.

Punk Music. Amiright? But, at the same, what the hell is it? Maybe, it's generating a little bit of Hype through an "explosive live show, involving aerobatics and theatrics", supporting The White Stripes and every half-decent Indie Rock Touring Band and then turning your two middle fingers up to all those expectations and re-recording your previously-released-pop-punk-perfections [1] on a $2 tape recorder in a small beach shack somewhere off the New Zealand coast, only accessible during low tide?

Maybe.

'Fuck The Golden Youth' (released via iconic NZ label Flying Nun) is 36 minutes of the best/rawest/cunt-punching/womb-destroying music ever recorded. The rawness of the debut LP was only extenuated further upon the release of the Auckland Stadium Power-Rock follow-up 'Crazy? Yes! Dumb? No!' in 2006, which dominated the proceeding year's Vodafone New Zealand Music Awards (the Kiwi ARIAs), winning 'Album of the Year', 'Best Group', 'Best Rock Album' and more.

The band would implode in 2010, only moments after inventing the genre 'shitgaze' via their Instant Classic final masterpiece 'Screens' [2]. Members were scattered across the world: recording Pitchfork-endorsed acid-psych-rock, transforming the aforementioned shitgaze foundations to 'troublegum pop' and/or joining Die!Die!Die! on their quest to become a boring My Bloody Valentine cover band. And while former-guitarist and Unknown Mortal Orchestra frontman Ruban Nielson hasn't ruled out a reunion, he did stipulate in a recent interview with Rolling Stone Australia that "it won't be anything like 'Golden Youth' because we're not fucking kids anymore".

In celebration of the 10th anniversary of 'Fuck The Golden Youth', the album has been released on 180 gram vinyl (for the first time?) and I've bought a copy [3]. Hopefully, it arrives in time [4]. I'm going to stuff a goose with some other food and then roast it. Expect a pack of Mint Slices for dessert.

Edit: see below screenshot 'chat' with Sam The Butcher From Bondi. 1) Pretty much the only clown in Sydney that sells this; 2) Sam tried to screw the pooch/Nailz, doesn't sit well with me, 3) i think you'll all agree you blokes aren't really worth a $150 meal (i estimated i'd need a 4kg bird to feed you fucks), 4) schedule isn't really feasible (who knew roasting stuff took 4 hours?), 

As such, I've decided to switch the meal up to chicken/pineapple (golden fruit) curry, Sri Lankan style. I know it's probably against some Dodds-enforced by-law that he'll let me know all about on Tuesday, but ya know 'punk music'. 

Really can't wait to argue with you guys about: a) how much more important this record is than anything At The Drive-In did; b) the lack of hooks; c) how Holc only likes this because new Facebook friend Gang of Dave gave them a heavy endorsement recently ("munt chux were a munt band" - David Le'aupepe (Gang Of Youths, Christianity) (2015))

2. "The beautiful yet unfathomable contradiction of this album is that after listening it becomes clear that this is the natural and obvious progression for the group to make, yet it's concepts could never have been imagined, calculated or stumbled upon by a million monkeys playing a billion instruments for a trillion years." - Polaroids of Androids (2009) - http://polaroidsofandroids.com/record-reviews/the-mint-chicks-screens/3971.html

4. This is relying on former-frontman Kody Nielson to ship this quickly, easily the least reliable of the Nielson brothers.
