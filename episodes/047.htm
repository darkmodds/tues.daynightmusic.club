Ahhh, suffice to say we've all suffocated in Sydney, a 'sin city' of sorts, labeled as such by our envious neighbors, scowling cynicism normally scoffed into imperial pints and shetland pony pale ales across this divided nation. We've choked on the exhaust fumes of the clogged Sydney roadways while choking down a mixed meat plate from one of the many five-star kebab outlets evenly scattered across this town. Like Brothers Kebabs on the western artery that is Parramatta Road, a short brick-throw up the way from the Annandale Hotel, a pub that seemed on track to pick up the slacks of those bearded hipsters that cried and died and Twitpic'd the demise of the Hopetoun Hotel, yet instead the Fuck This We're Going To The Annandale Hotel chose the pathway of putting on Dallas Crane six nights a week for six years, with Sticky Fingerz in the front bar playing the banjo and selling bad coke to Bra Boys.

This is Sydney. A town where the tide is high from the flooded stormwater drains, following decades of poor town planning and bureaucratic bottlenecks at local governing councils. A city of proposed tunnel solutions, pubs repurposing innocent fortnightly dinner parties for their own Pistonhead-sponsored band nights and businesses surviving primarily off the back of their cleverly executed puns (and proximity to folklore-drenched cricket drinking holes).

A city where you don't need beanies, as you get your required weekly refried bean intake from the numerous Mexican restaurants leftover from the 2009 boom period. What a time to be alive that was - Oxford Art Factory hadn't yet transitioned into serving schmiddies disguised as pints and you couldn't swing a Justin Helmes gay rumour without hitting an emerging small bar with a colourful menu of cocktails and sliders so small you could be forgiven for thinking they didn't exist at all. And it was the same year, whilst on a nation-wide pilgrimage following Casiotone For The Painfully Alone [1], I met a strapped young bloke known simply as "RAV".

We've had some beers. Boy, did we have some beers. All seven sizes of beers this country has legally endorsed. And now, our lovable, tactless, ravioli-consuming comrade is heading south for new beers in new sizes in the milk-crate capital of Australia. He'll inevitably find new haunts in his new home, cafes disguised as pubs (and vice-versa), perfect places for profound statements on favourite Paul Kelly lines and artesian cuisine that soaks up last night's pots. Ah, last night, really did happen with a snap. 4am at one of The Tote's infamous band competitions, with members of Total Control and The UV Race lurking around every corner. A far cry from the O'Farrell 8pm lock-out laws and mandatory king hits of Nathan's former home. 

Yes, it's true and it's sad. In that order. Nathan "Rav" Wood is moving to Melbourne to be closer to Wil Wagner. Fuck it, he might even start drinking Melbourne Bitter. And he'll inevitably start posting videos on Facebook of the Top Ten Specky Marks of 2015. And we'll start to hate him, disguise our disgust under jokes like "the only Mark I know is Dodds and he's a racist faggot". 

But until then, we have now. Boy do we have a lot of now. And let's fill that time with one last hurrah for our favourite Kim Tan booty-calling bro (sorry Cam).

I'll slow cook some mutton, and side it with some kidney beans and another vegetable that puns nicely with the word "satellite". This is a special collaborative TNMC hosting - thanks Mark for letting me have one of his 412 reserved puns, thanks Holc for the stern nudge and thanks Moore for driving.

And, of course, we'll listen to the man Rav will miss the most - Adam "Gibbo" Gibson - 'Satellite Nights' during the main meal and a re-ordered version of the 'This is Sydney' EP during the post-meal "favourite Rav story" wrap-up.
